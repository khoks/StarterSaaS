  "reason": "Before ending this session, run three project skills in order:\n\n1. **harvest-knowledge** — sweep this conversation for any new vision items, feature ideas, architectural / performance / scaling / infrastructure / tech-stack decisions, novel or patentable ideas, and crucial product or engineering decisions. Update the matching docs: docs/vision/RECOMMENDED_ADDITIONS.md, docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md or a new ADR, docs/decisions/DECISIONS_LOG.md, docs/vision/NOVEL_IDEAS.md. Skip only if the conversation introduced literally nothing new worth persisting — and say so explicitly.\n\n2. **work-tracking** — sweep this conversation for new requirements / scope changes / status changes affecting Epics, Stories, or Tasks. Create new items where needed (using project/TEMPLATES/), update statuses with activity-log entries, and refresh project/BOARD.md. Skip only if nothing changed — and say so.\n\n3. **auto-pr** — branch off main, commit the doc + tracking updates from steps 1 and 2, push, open a PR, enable auto-merge. Skip if both prior skills said 'nothing to persist' AND there are no other staged changes.\n\nThen mark this session housekept so this hook stops blocking:\n\n  mkdir -p .claude/state && touch .claude/state/housekept-$SESSION_ID\n\nAnd attempt to stop again."
